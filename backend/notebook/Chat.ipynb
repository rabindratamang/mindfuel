According to the World Health Organization (WHO), burnout is specifically related to chronic workplace stress that hasn't been effectively managed. \\n\\n### Key Symptoms of Burnout:\\n1. **Energy Depletion**: You may feel a sense of exhaustion or depletion that doesn\\u2019t improve even with rest.\\n2. **Mental Distance**: This can manifest as feelings of detachment or cynicism regarding your job or responsibilities.\\n3. **Reduced Efficacy**: You might find it hard to perform well or feel less accomplished at work, even in tasks that once brought you satisfaction.\\n\\nIt's important to note that while recognized as a work-related phenomenon, burnout is not classified as a medical or psychiatric condition by the WHO. However, it can sometimes align with symptoms of depression.\\n\\nBurnout can significantly impact your overall well-being, especially during high-pressure situations like final exams. If you find yourself feeling disconnected or exhausted, it may be a sign to take a step back and focus on self-care. Would you like to explore some strategies to help manage stress and avoid burnout during this challenging time?\",\n",
